Few Instruction to make your work easy to see how it's working
1. Make a venv for the app using python -m venv env
2. Start venv using source env/Scripts/activate
3. Install all requirents using pip install -r  requirements.txt
4. there are two folders a.backend or frontent frontent is in flask python and frontend is in vue.js
5. To Start the app you need two seperate terminals a. python app.py to selfstart flaskserver on port (5000)
                                                    b. vue serve to selfstart the vue.js on differnt port(8000)
